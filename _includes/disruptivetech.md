&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp       Due to e-commerce, business models are shifted to include or switch to e-commerce platforms apart from their physical store-front shops. Scaling up one’s business has never been easier and cheaper before, compared to up-keeping physical brick-and-mortar establishments. Additionally, the customers themselves act as the business’s advertiser through reviews and self-searching wherein e-commerce platform algorithms advertise the products to their users for “free”.
<br>
<br>                      
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  E-commerce has allowed businesses to operate 24 hours a day and be accessible to wider range of consumers from distant places (Morris 2021), giving the business more flexibility and a bigger customer population pool. One huge benefit of e-commerce was the ability of companies to penetrate the international market. Through online shopping platforms, local businesses can offer their products to international consumers and have them delivered (Kiran, 2020). Thus, instead of the traditional way of being a multinational company, firms today have a more convenient way in pursuit of growth.
<br>
<br>                   
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   On the other hand, data collection features in e-commerce platforms provide business owners with statistical data about consumers that they can use to scout what products are the most or least popular in their shops. They can also use this data to improve their marketing strategy by including popular keywords related to their product to give them a boost in web searchability. Data collection is then improving the ability of businesses to listen to what the customers want (Liqui-site 2020).

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    Transactions are becoming more flexible because of e-commerce, consumers are much smarter because of ability to compare prices of similar products from different shops that are instantly available in one platform instead of canvassing them separately. Meanwhile, businesses are forced to open up several payment methods to accommodate the preferences of each consumer (Dey, 2022).

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Business owners do not need a physical store to conduct business and those that switch to online platforms are leaving behind a lot of vacancies from their previous locations (e.g. shopping malls, renting spaces). These malls that used to house businesses are not exactly receiving regression, rather they are predicted to adapt to the changes brought up by e-commerce. According to Kodali (2022), these malls will shift to hosting more physical service-based businesses instead of product-based shops. Product-based shops either switch to e-commerce or exist in both e-commerce and physical stores, thus the establishment will cater these type of tenants. Malls will adapt by welcoming more occupants that will use the spaces for civic activity offices, hair salons, clinics (for people/pets), gyms, and other in person services to fill in the vacant spaces. In return, it will change how people envisioned malls and those of the similar operational industry.
